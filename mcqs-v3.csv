March compe 3,"We know the maxima-minima concept that, If an integer needs to break into two parts, then to maximize their product those parts should be equal. Using this concept let's break n into (n/x) x’s then their product will be x(n/x), now if we take the derivative of this product and make that equal to 0 for maxima, we will get to know that value of x should be e (base of the natural logarithm) for the maximum product. As we know that 2 < e < 3, so we should break every Integer into 2 or 3 only for the maximum product.
Next thing is 6 = 3 + 3 = 2 + 2 + 2, but 3 * 3 > 2 * 2 * 2, that is every triplet of 2 can be replaced with tuple of 3 for maximum product, so we will keep breaking the number in terms of 3 only, until number remains as 4 or 2, which we will be broken into 2*2 (2*2 > 3*1) and 2 respectively and we will get our maximum product.

It is a 32-bit data type and therefore, can store a total of 2<sup>32</sup> different values. These values range from int_min = -2<sup>31</sup> to int_max = 2<sup>31</sup>-1. The special feature about integers is that they follow rotation property, i.e., int_max + 1 = int_min. The strangest thing about integers is that the absolute value of int_min = int_min since the absolute value of int_min in literal terms is int_max + 1.

October Entrance Section C - Slot 3,"Let's study some interesting facts about factors of a number today.
In the number system the concept of factors of numbers is one of the important subtopics. Factors of a number any number “ P”  refers to all the numbers which are exactly divisible on “P” i.e remainder comes to zero. These factors of numbers are also called divisors of a number.One way to check factors is to iterate from 1 to P and check for each number if it is a divisor or not. However we can do it more efficiently. We just have to iterate from 1 to square root of P.  Rest of the divisors can be found by just dividing the number P with the found divisor.
Now let's discuss the number of factors for a number. Number of factors for a number P totally depends upon its prime factors. More the number of prime factors more the number of divisors.

Many regions have starkly different microclimates. <br /> The country's meteorological department follows the international standard of four climatological seasons with some local adjustments: winter (December, January and February), <br /> summer (March, April and May), a monsoon rainy season (June to September), and a post-monsoon period (October to November).India's geography and geology are climatically pivotal: the Thar Desert in the northwest and the Himalayas in the north work in tandem to affect<br/> a culturally and economically important monsoonal regime. As Earth's highest and most massive mountain range, the Himalayas bar the influx of frigid katabatic winds from the <br />icy Tibetan Plateau and northerly Central Asia.

August Entrance Section - C,"<b>Passage</b>

Let's talk about the array data structure in C today.
Arrays in C are contiguous memory areas that hold a number of values of the same data type(like characters, integers). For example,
Suppose a class has 27 students, and we need to store the grades of all of them. Instead of creating 27 separate variables, we can simply create an array:
It's like a table in which multiple containers are aligned in a manner to form a table-like structure. Each collector has a unique index starting from 0. You can define the size of your table. Suppose you define an array of size N then the index of collectors will go like 0,1,2...N-1 You can only access the collector by its index number for both storing and retrieving the data. For eg:- Let the name of the array be Arr and its size be 5 then Arr[0], Arr[1], Arr[2], Arr[3] and Arr[4] will be the names of the collectors.
Also, each collector has a memory allocated to it depending upon its data type for eg:- memory allocated to an integer is 4 bytes.

What is the minimum memory to be allocated so that we can store the frequencies of even numbers ranging from -1000 to 1000.",Multiple Choice Question,"1, 2, 3, 4",4000 bytes,8000 bytes,2000 bytes,1000 bytes,,A,-,LEVEL 3

Suppose you want to find a word in a dictionary then what will you do, one way is that you start from the front page and compare each word, but that would take so long don't you think. The other way is that you randomly open a page compare the word then according to the word you search for either part of the dictionary and repeat the process until you find the word you seek. Now think of it as an approach for finding an element x in a sorted list of elements. The efficient way for finding element x will be:-
Compare x with the middle element. If x matches with the middle element, we found it.
Else If x is greater than the mid element, then x can only lie in right half after the mid element. So we recur for the right half.
Else (x is smaller) recur for the left half. We repeat the process until we find the element. i. e each time we cut the size of the list half.

October Entrance Section C - Slot 2,"Let’s find a way to calculate the number of trailing zeros in a factorial of a number. A simple method would be to first calculate the factorial then just count the number of zeros however it will be extremely difficult to do so for big numbers. It is possible to calculate it efficiently by considering the prime factors of the number. As a trailing zero can only be produced by the product of 2 and 5. If we can count the number of 5s and 2s, our task is done. We can easily observe that the number of 2s in prime factors is always more than or equal to the number of 5s. So if we count 5s in prime factors, we are done. There is one more catch in this approach: We also need to watch for the power of 5 as it will produce more 5s which will increase the number of trailing zeros in our factorial.

For eg:- 3 and 4 are coprime. Here we try to find the number of coprime less than or equal to the number N like the number of coprime for 2 is 1 for 4 it is 2 for 7 it is 6. A simple way to calculate coprime will be to check for each number from 1 to N however it will be difficult for large numbers. We can make use of the fact that coprime will solemnly depend upon the number of prime factors of N.

The formula for calculating the number of coprime will be:-

&empty;(n) = n&prod;<sub>p/n</sub>(1 - 1/p),       Here p is the prime factor of n.

Section C,"Expected value (also known as EV, expectation, average, or mean value) is a long-run average value of random variables. It also indicates the probability-weighted average of all possible values. 
The first variation of the expected value formula is the EV of one event repeated several times (think about tossing a coin). In such a case, the EV can be found using the following formula:
 Where:
EV – the expected value
P(X) – the probability of the event
n – the number of the repetitions of the event
 However, in finance, many problems related to the expected value involve multiple events. In such a scenario, the EV is the probability-weighted average of all possible events. Therefore, the general formula to find the EV for multiple events is: EV = ∑ P(X<sub>i</sub>) *X<sub>i</sub> Where
EV = Expected Value
P(X<sub>i</sub>) = Probability of the even
X<sub>i</sub> = Event

August Entrance Section - C,"<b>Passage</b>

Let's talk about array data structure in C today.
Arrays in C are contiguous memory areas that hold a number of values of the same data type(like characters, integers). For example,
Suppose a class has 27 students, and we need to store the grades of all of them. Instead of creating 27 separate variables, we can simply create an array:
It's like a table in which multiple containers are aligned in a manner to form a table-like structure. Each collector has a unique index starting from 0. You can define the size of your table. Suppose you define an array of size N then the index of collectors will go like 0,1,2...N-1 You can only access the collector by its index number for both storing and retrieving the data. For eg:- Let the name of the array be Arr and its size be 5 then Arr[0], Arr[1], Arr[2], Arr[3] and Arr[4] will be the names of the collectors.
Also, each collector has a memory allocated to it depending upon its data type for eg:- memory allocated to an integer is 4 bytes.


<b>Question</b>
We want to store the test data of 50 students with roll numbers ranging from 1 to 50 and the scores ranging from 1 to 100.

June Entrance Section C - Slot 2,"Expected value (also known as EV, expectation, average, or mean value) is a long-run average value of random variables. It also indicates the probability-weighted average of all possible values. 
The first variation of the expected value formula is the EV of one event repeated several times (think about tossing a coin). In such a case, the EV can be found using the following formula:
 Where:
<ul>
<li>EV – the expected value</li>
<li>P(X) – the probability of the event</li>
<li>n – the number of the repetitions of the event</li>
</ul>

However, in finance, many problems related to the expected value involve multiple events. In such a scenario, the EV is the probability-weighted average of all possible events. Therefore, the general formula to find the EV for multiple events is: EV = ∑ P(X<sub>i</sub>) *X<sub>i</sub> Where
EV = Expected Value
P(X<sub>i</sub>) = Probability of the even
X<sub>i</sub> - Event

June Entrance Section C - Slot 2,"Expected value (also known as EV, expectation, average, or mean value) is a long-run average value of random variables. It also indicates the probability-weighted average of all possible values. 
The first variation of the expected value formula is the EV of one event repeated several times (think about tossing a coin). In such a case, the EV can be found using the following formula:
 Where:
<ul>
<li>EV – the expected value</li>
<li>P(X) – the probability of the event</li>
<li>n – the number of the repetitions of the event</li>
</ul>

However, in finance, many problems related to the expected value involve multiple events. In such a scenario, the EV is the probability-weighted average of all possible events. Therefore, the general formula to find the EV for multiple events is: EV = ∑ P(X<sub>i</sub>) *X<sub>i</sub> Where
EV = Expected Value
P(X<sub>i</sub>) = Probability of the even
X<sub>i</sub> - Event

For eg:- 3 and 4 are coprime. Here we try to find the number of coprime less than or equal to the number N like the number of coprime for 2 is 1 for 4 it is 2 for 7 it is 6. A simple way to calculate coprime will be to check for each number from 1 to N however it will be difficult for large numbers. We can make use of the fact that coprime will solemnly depend upon the number of prime factors of N.

The formula for calculating the number of coprime will be:-

&empty;(n) = n&prod;<sub>p/n</sub>(1 - 1/p),       Here p is the prime factor of n.

Suppose you want to find a word in a dictionary then what will you do, one way is that you start from the front page and compare each word, but that would take so long don't you think. The other way is that you randomly open a page compare the word then according to the word you search for either part of the dictionary and repeat the process until you find the word you seek. Now think of it as an approach for finding an element x in a sorted list of elements. The efficient way for finding element x will be:-
Compare x with the middle element. If x matches with the middle element, we found it.
Else If x is greater than the mid element, then x can only lie in right half after the mid element. So we recur for the right half.
Else (x is smaller) recur for the left half. We repeat the process until we find the element. i. e each time we cut the size of the list half.

Let’s recall our memories of Logic Gates between two operators such as AND, OR, and XOR.
 Let’s denote these operations using standard symbols used for them.
& - AND
|| - OR
^ - XOR
 
AND gate will be open only when both the operators are true. 
OR gate will be open when either of the operators are true
XOR gate will be open only when one of the operator is true and the other one is false
Now let's try to perform the logic gate operation between two numbers. For example:-
Let's take 3 and 5 which are 11 and 101 in binary 
3 & 5 :- 011(&) 101 = 001 = 1
3 || 5 :- 011(||)101 = 111 = 7

March compe 4,"The Decimal Number System is also called ""Base 10"", because it is based on the number 10. It has 10 symbols as 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. But notice something interesting: there is no symbol for ""ten"". ""10"" is actually two symbols put together, a ""1"" and a ""0""
In decimal you count ""0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,..."" but then you run out of symbols! So you add 1 on the left and then start again at 0: 10,11,12, ...
 Now similar to this we can have more number systems like binary where we use only 0 and 1 with the same concept as it was in decimal:-
0 -> 0, 1 -> 1, 2 -> 10, 3 -> 11, 4 -> 100. . . .. 15->1111.. and  so on.
Other than binary and decimal we have 
octal number system which uses:- {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7}
hexadecimal:-They look the same as the decimal numbers up to 9, but then there are the letters (""A',""B"",""C"",""D"",""E"",""F"") in place of the decimal numbers 10 to 15. For ex A5 = 165, B0 = 176

Let's have some fun with binary numbers today:-
We all know that a binary number is a number expressed in the base-2 numeral system or binary numeral system, which uses only two symbols: typically ""0"" (zero) and ""1"" (one). For eg:- 3 written as 11, 4 as 100, 5 as 101 and so on.
We have some shifts in binary numbers called as Bit shifts, The bit shifts are sometimes considered bitwise operations because they treat a value as a series of bits rather than as a numerical quantity. In these operations, the digits are moved, or shifted, to the left or right. For eg:- let's pick 10 it's binary representation will be 1010 by shifting the bits to the left means adding a zero at last that it the representation will become 10100 which donates 20, however, right shifts make it 101 which donates the number 5 one more right shift will delete the last 1 which makes the representation as 10 which depicts 2.
Also, we have some operation in a binary number is:-

XOR:-
The result of the bitwise XOR operator is 1 if the corresponding bits of two operands are opposite.
Bitwise XOR Operation of 12 and 25

January Entrance Section C - Slot 2,"Modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers, which considers the remainder. In modular arithmetic, numbers ""wrap around"" upon reaching a given fixed quantity (this given quantity is known as the modulus) to leave a remainder. Modular arithmetic is often tied to prime numbers, for instance, in Wilson's theorem, Lucas's theorem, and Hensel's lemma, and generally appears in fields like cryptography, computer science, and computer algebra.

An intuitive usage of modular arithmetic is with a 12-hour clock. If it is 10:00 now, then in 5 hours the clock will show 3:00 instead of 15:00. 3 is the remainder of 15 with a modulus of 12.

A number x mod N is the equivalent of asking for the remainder of x when divided by N. Two integers a and b are said to be congruent (or in the same equivalence class) modulo N if they have the same remainder upon division by N. In such a case, we say that a≡b(modN).

A modulus operation is commonly expressed using the % operator. Eg 17%5=2 indicates that a remainder of 2 is left when 17 is divided by 5.

The operations of addition, multiplication and exponentiation follow the same rules under modular arithmetic. For example,

(7*3) % 5 = 21 % 5 = 1
Or
(7*3) % 5 = ((7%5) * (3%5)) % 5 = (2*3) % 5 = 6 % 5 = 1

Addition and exponentiation can be distributed over modulus in the same way.

March compe 3,"Let’s find a way to calculate the number of trailing zeros in a factorial of a number. A simple method would be to first calculate the factorial then just count the number of zeros however it will be extremely difficult to do so for big numbers. It is possible to calculate it efficiently by considering the prime factors of the number. As a trailing zero can only be produced by the product of 2 and 5. If we can count the number of 5s and 2s, our task is done. We can easily observe that the number of 2s in prime factors is always more than or equal to the number of 5s. So if we count 5s in prime factors, we are done. There is one more catch in this approach: We also need to watch for the power of 5 as it will produce more 5s which will increase the number of trailing zeros in our factorial.

The special feature about integers is that they follow rotation property, i.e., int_max + 1 = int_min.

<b>Passage</b>
Lets have some fun with binary numbers today:-
We all know that a binary number is a number expressed in the base-2 numeral system or binary numeral system, which uses only two symbols: typically ""0"" (zero) and ""1"" (one). For eg:- 3 written as 11, 4 as 100, 5 as 101 and so on.
We have some shifts in binary numbers called as Bit shifts, The bit shifts are sometimes considered bitwise operations because they treat a value as a series of bits rather than as a numerical quantity. In these operations, the digits are moved, or shifted, to the left or right. For eg:- let's pick 10 it's binary representation will be 1010 by shifting the bits to the left means adding a zero at last that it the representation will become 10100 which donates 20, however, right shifts make it 101 which donates the number 5 one more right shift will delete the last 1 which makes the representation as 10 which depicts 2.
Also, we have some operation in a binary number is:-

XOR:-
The result of the bitwise XOR operator is 1 if the corresponding bits of two operands are opposite.
Bitwise XOR Operation of 12 and 25
         01100
XOR 11001
         _____

October Entrance Section C - Slot 1,"GCD or HCF of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them. A simple way to find GCD is to factorize both numbers and multiply common factors. Now to calculating it faster, we can use the facts:-
If we subtract the smaller number from the larger (we reduce the larger number), GCD doesn’t change. So if we keep subtracting repeatedly the larger of two, we end up with GCD.
Now instead of subtraction, if we divide smaller number, the algorithm stops when we find remainder 0.
By using these facts it will become easy to find the GCD of two numbers. 
Extending the approach can also be used to find the solutions of the equation for x and y:-
a⋅x+b⋅y=gcd of (a, b)

October Entrance Section C - Slot 2,"Let’s find a way to calculate the number of trailing zeros in a factorial of a number. A simple method would be to first calculate the factorial then just count the number of zeros however it will be extremely difficult to do so for big numbers. It is possible to calculate it efficiently by considering the prime factors of the number. As a trailing zero can only be produced by the product of 2 and 5. If we can count the number of 5s and 2s, our task is done. We can easily observe that the number of 2s in prime factors is always more than or equal to the number of 5s. So if we count 5s in prime factors, we are done. There is one more catch in this approach: We also need to watch for the power of 5 as it will produce more 5s which will increase the number of trailing zeros in our factorial.

The special feature about integers is that they follow rotation property, i.e., int_max + 1 = int_min.

Many regions have starkly different microclimates. <br /> The country's meteorological department follows the international standard of four climatological seasons with some local adjustments: winter (December, January and February), <br /> summer (March, April and May), a monsoon rainy season (June to September), and a post-monsoon period (October to November).India's geography and geology are climatically pivotal: the Thar Desert in the northwest and the Himalayas in the north work in tandem to affect<br/> a culturally and economically important monsoonal regime. As Earth's highest and most massive mountain range, the Himalayas bar the influx of frigid katabatic winds from the <br />icy Tibetan Plateau and northerly Central Asia.

Section C,"Modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers, which considers the remainder. In modular arithmetic, numbers ""wrap around"" upon reaching a given fixed quantity (this given quantity is known as the modulus) to leave a remainder. Modular arithmetic is often tied to prime numbers, for instance, in Wilson's theorem, Lucas's theorem, and Hensel's lemma, and generally appears in fields like cryptography, computer science, and computer algebra.

Intuitive usage of modular arithmetic is with a 12-hour clock. If it is 10:00 now, then in 5 hours the clock will show 3:00 instead of 15:00. 3 is the remainder of 15 with a modulus of 12.

A number x mod N is the equivalent of asking for the remainder of x when divided by N. Two integers a and b are said to be congruent (or in the same equivalence class) modulo N if they have the same remainder upon division by N. In such a case, we say that a≡b(modN).

A modulus operation is commonly expressed using the % operator. Eg 17%5=2 indicates that a remainder of 2 is left when 17 is divided by 5.

The operations of addition, multiplication and exponentiation follow the same rules under modular arithmetic. For example,

(7*3) % 5 = 21 % 5 = 1
Or
(7*3) % 5 = ((7%5) * (3%5)) % 5 = (2*3) % 5 = 6 % 5 = 1

Addition and exponentiation can be distributed over modulus in the same way.

May 3rd Slot Comprehension,"We all know that a binary number is a number expressed in the base-2 numeral system or binary numeral system, which uses only two symbols: typically ""0"" (zero) and ""1"" (one). For eg:- 3 written as 11, 4 as 100, 5 as 101 and so on. And if we now increase the base we get base 3 form then base 4 form and so on. Like 15 in base 3 will be written as:- 120 = 3^2(1) + 3^1(2) + 3^0(0). The method to find the base is easy: you keep on dividing the decimal number with the base and note their remainder until the number becomes 0. It’s easy to see that in the base representation none of the digits can be equal to base or exceed it keeping that in mind the addition and subtraction operation will be performed. For eg in base 3 :- 120 + 110 =    1000. In decimal it will be 15 + 12 = 27. Also if the base exceeds 10 then we will use A,B,C,D.. instead of 10,11,12…..

<b>Passage</b>

Let's talk about the array data structure in C today.
Arrays in C are contiguous memory areas that hold a number of values of the same data type(like characters, integers). For example,
Suppose a class has 27 students, and we need to store the grades of all of them. Instead of creating 27 separate variables, we can simply create an array:
It's like a table in which multiple containers are aligned in a manner to form a table-like structure. Each collector has a unique index starting from 0. You can define the size of your table. Suppose you define an array of size N then the index of collectors will go like 0,1,2...N-1 You can only access the collector by its index number for both storing and retrieving the data. For eg:- Let the name of the array be Arr and its size be 5 then Arr[0], Arr[1], Arr[2], Arr[3] and Arr[4] will be the names of the collectors.
Also, each collector has a memory allocated to it depending upon its data type for eg:- memory allocated to an integer is 4 bytes

If it happens to be the train traveling north, he’ll visit his friend Giyan uptown, and if it happens to be the train traveling south, he’ll visit his friend Sunio downtown. Both of his friends are okay with this plan, since they know both the northbound and southbound trains run every 20 minutes.

Let’s recall our memories of Logic Gates between two operators such as AND, OR, and XOR.
Let’s denote these operations using standard symbols used for them.
& - AND
|| - OR
^ - XOR
 
AND gate will be open only when both the operators are true. 
OR gate will be open when either of the operators is true
XOR gate will be open only when one of the operators is true and the other one is false
Now let's try to perform the logic gate operation between two numbers. For example:-
Let's take 3 and 5 which are 11 and 101 in binary 
3 & 5 :- 011(&) 101 = 001 = 1
3 || 5 :- 011(||)101 = 111 = 7

Many regions have starkly different microclimates. <br /> The country's meteorological department follows the international standard of four climatological seasons with some local adjustments: winter (December, January and February), <br /> summer (March, April and May), a monsoon rainy season (June to September), and a post-monsoon period (October to November).India's geography and geology are climatically pivotal: the Thar Desert in the northwest and the Himalayas in the north work in tandem to affect<br/> a culturally and economically important monsoonal regime. As Earth's highest and most massive mountain range, the Himalayas bar the influx of frigid katabatic winds from the <br />icy Tibetan Plateau and northerly Central Asia. Most of North India is thus kept warm or is only mildly chilly or cold during winter; the same thermal dam keeps most regions in India hot in summer.<br/><strong>Q4.

October Entrance Section C - Slot 2,"Let’s find a way to calculate the number of trailing zeros in a factorial of a number. A simple method would be to first calculate the factorial then just count the number of zeros however it will be extremely difficult to do so for big numbers. It is possible to calculate it efficiently by considering the prime factors of the number. As a trailing zero can only be produced by the product of 2 and 5. If we can count the number of 5s and 2s, our task is done. We can easily observe that the number of 2s in prime factors is always more than or equal to the number of 5s. So if we count 5s in prime factors, we are done. There is one more catch in this approach: We also need to watch for the power of 5 as it will produce more 5s which will increase the number of trailing zeros in our factorial.

Section C,"Expected value (also known as EV, expectation, average, or mean value) is a long-run average value of random variables. It also indicates the probability-weighted average of all possible values. 
The first variation of the expected value formula is the EV of one event repeated several times (think about tossing a coin). In such a case, the EV can be found using the following formula:
 Where:
EV – the expected value
P(X) – the probability of the event
n – the number of the repetitions of the event
 However, in finance, many problems related to the expected value involve multiple events. In such a scenario, the EV is the probability-weighted average of all possible events. Therefore, the general formula to find the EV for multiple events is: EV = ∑ P(X<sub>i</sub>) *X<sub>i</sub> Where
EV = Expected Value
P(X<sub>i</sub>) = Probability of the even
X<sub>i</sub> = Event

March compre 2,"We all know that a binary number is a number expressed in the base-2 numeral system or binary numeral system, which uses only two symbols: typically ""0"" (zero) and ""1"" (one). For eg:- 3 written as 11, 4 as 100, 5 as 101 and so on. 
Let’s recall our memories of Logic Gates between two operators such as AND, OR and XOR.
 Let’s denote these operations using standard symbols used for them.
& - AND
|| - OR
^ - XOR
 
AND gate will be open only when both the operators are true. 
OR gate will be open when either of the operators are true
XOR gate will be open only when one of the operator is true and the other one is false
Now let's try to perform the logic gate operation between two numbers. For example:-
Let's take 3 and 5 which are 11 and 101 in binary 
3 & 5 :- 011(&) 101 = 001 = 1
3 || 5 :- 011(||)101 = 111 = 7

Many regions have starkly different microclimates. <br /> The country's meteorological department follows the international standard of four climatological seasons with some local adjustments: winter (December, January and February), <br /> summer (March, April and May), a monsoon rainy season (June to September), and a post-monsoon period (October to November).India's geography and geology are climatically pivotal: the Thar Desert in the northwest and the Himalayas in the north work in tandem to affect<br/> a culturally and economically important monsoonal regime. As Earth's highest and most massive mountain range, the Himalayas bar the influx of frigid katabatic winds from the <br />icy Tibetan Plateau and northerly Central Asia. Most of North India is thus kept warm or is only mildly chilly or cold during winter; the same thermal dam keeps most regions in India hot in summer.<br/><strong>Q3.

<b>Passage</b>

We know the maxima-minima concept that, If an integer needs to break in two parts, then to maximize their product those parts should be equal. Using this concept let's break n into (n/x) x’s then their product will be x(n/x), now if we take the derivative of this product and make that equal to 0 for maxima, we will get to know that value of x should be e (base of the natural logarithm) for the maximum product. As we know that 2 < e < 3, so we should break every Integer into 2 or 3 only for the maximum product.
Next thing is 6 = 3 + 3 = 2 + 2 + 2, but 3 * 3 > 2 * 2 * 2, that is every triplet of 2 can be replaced with a tuple of 3 for a maximum product, so we will keep breaking the number in terms of 3 only until number remains as 4 or 2, which we will be broken into 2*2 (2*2 > 3*1) and 2 respectively and we will get our maximum product.

October Entrance Section C - Slot 1,"GCD or HCF of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them. A simple way to find GCD is to factorize both numbers and multiply common factors. Now to calculating it faster, we can use the facts:-
If we subtract the smaller number from the larger (we reduce the larger number), GCD doesn’t change. So if we keep subtracting repeatedly the larger of two, we end up with GCD.
Now instead of subtraction, if we divide smaller number, the algorithm stops when we find remainder 0.
By using these facts it will become easy to find the GCD of two numbers. 
Extending the approach can also be used to find the solutions of the equation for x and y:-

May 3rd Slot Comprehension,"We all know that a binary number is a number expressed in the base-2 numeral system or binary numeral system, which uses only two symbols: typically ""0"" (zero) and ""1"" (one). For eg:- 3 written as 11, 4 as 100, 5 as 101 and so on. And if we now increase the base we get base 3 form then base 4 form and so on. Like 15 in base 3 will be written as:- 120 = 3^2(1) + 3^1(2) + 3^0(0). The method to find the base is easy: you keep on dividing the decimal number with the base and note their remainder until the number becomes 0. It’s easy to see that in the base representation none of the digits can be equal to base or exceed it keeping that in mind the addition and subtraction operation will be performed. For eg in base 3 :- 120 + 110 =    1000. In decimal it will be 15 + 12 = 27. Also if the base exceeds 10 then we will use A,B,C,D.. instead of 10,11,12…..

Section C,"Modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers, which considers the remainder. In modular arithmetic, numbers ""wrap around"" upon reaching a given fixed quantity (this given quantity is known as the modulus) to leave a remainder. Modular arithmetic is often tied to prime numbers, for instance, in Wilson's theorem, Lucas's theorem, and Hensel's lemma, and generally appears in fields like cryptography, computer science, and computer algebra.

Intuitive usage of modular arithmetic is with a 12-hour clock. If it is 10:00 now, then in 5 hours the clock will show 3:00 instead of 15:00. 3 is the remainder of 15 with a modulus of 12.

A number x mod N is the equivalent of asking for the remainder of x when divided by N. Two integers a and b are said to be congruent (or in the same equivalence class) modulo N if they have the same remainder upon division by N. In such a case, we say that a≡b(modN).

A modulus operation is commonly expressed using the % operator. Eg 17%5=2 indicates that a remainder of 2 is left when 17 is divided by 5.

The operations of addition, multiplication and exponentiation follow the same rules under modular arithmetic. For example,

(7*3) % 5 = 21 % 5 = 1
Or
(7*3) % 5 = ((7%5) * (3%5)) % 5 = (2*3) % 5 = 6 % 5 = 1

Addition and exponentiation can be distributed over modulus in the same way.

October Entrance Section C - Slot 1,"We know the maxima-minima concept that, If an integer needs to break in two parts, then to maximize their product those parts should be equal. Using this concept let's break n into (n/x) x’s then their product will be x(n/x), now if we take derivative of this product and make that equal to 0 for maxima, we will get to know that value of x should be e (base of the natural logarithm) for maximum product. As we know that 2 < e < 3, so we should break every Integer into 2 or 3 only for the maximum product.
Next thing is 6 = 3 + 3 = 2 + 2 + 2, but 3 * 3 > 2 * 2 * 2, that is every triplet of 2 can be replaced with tuple of 3 for maximum product, so we will keep breaking the number in terms of 3 only, until number remains as 4 or 2, which we will be broken into 2*2 (2*2 > 3*1) and 2 respectively and we will get our maximum product.

March compe 3,"Let’s find a way to calculate the number of trailing zeros in a factorial of a number. A simple method would be to first calculate the factorial then just count the number of zeros however it will be extremely difficult to do so for big numbers. It is possible to calculate it efficiently by considering the prime factors of the number. As a trailing zero can only be produced by the product of 2 and 5. If we can count the number of 5s and 2s, our task is done. We can easily observe that the number of 2s in prime factors is always more than or equal to the number of 5s. So if we count 5s in prime factors, we are done. There is one more catch in this approach: We also need to watch for the power of 5 as it will produce more 5s which will increase the number of trailing zeros in our factorial.

May compe,"GCD or HCF of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them. A simple way to find GCD is to factorize both numbers and multiply common factors. Now for calculating it faster we can use tha facts:-
1. If we subtract smaller numbers from larger (we reduce larger number), GCD doesn’t change. So if we keep subtracting repeatedly the larger of two, we end up with GCD.
2. Now instead of subtraction, if we divide a smaller number, the algorithm stops when we find remainder 0.
By using these facts it will become easy to find the GCD of two numbers. 
Extending the approach can also be used to find the solutions of the equation for x and y:-
a⋅x+b⋅y=gcd of (a,b)

March compe 4,"The Decimal Number System is also called ""Base 10"", because it is based on the number 10. It has 10 symbols as 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. But notice something interesting: there is no symbol for ""ten"". ""10"" is actually two symbols put together, a ""1"" and a ""0""
In decimal you count ""0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,..."" but then you run out of symbols! So you add 1 on the left and then start again at 0: 10,11,12, ...
 Now similar to this we can have more number systems like binary where we use only 0 and 1 with the same concept as it was in decimal:-
0 -> 0, 1 -> 1, 2 -> 10, 3 -> 11, 4 -> 100. . . .. 15->1111.. and  so on.
Other than binary and decimal we have 
octal number system which uses:- {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7}
hexadecimal:-They look the same as the decimal numbers up to 9, but then there are the letters (""A',""B"",""C"",""D"",""E"",""F"") in place of the decimal numbers 10 to 15. For ex A5 = 165, B0 = 176

October Entrance Section C - Slot 1,"We know the maxima-minima concept that, If an integer needs to break in two parts, then to maximize their product those parts should be equal. Using this concept let's break n into (n/x) x’s then their product will be x(n/x), now if we take derivative of this product and make that equal to 0 for maxima, we will get to know that value of x should be e (base of the natural logarithm) for maximum product. As we know that 2 < e < 3, so we should break every Integer into 2 or 3 only for the maximum product.
Next thing is 6 = 3 + 3 = 2 + 2 + 2, but 3 * 3 > 2 * 2 * 2, that is every triplet of 2 can be replaced with tuple of 3 for maximum product, so we will keep breaking the number in terms of 3 only, until number remains as 4 or 2, which we will be broken into 2*2 (2*2 > 3*1) and 2 respectively and we will get our maximum product.

May compe 2,"Let's have some fun with binary numbers today:-
We all know that a binary number is a number expressed in the base-2 numeral system or binary numeral system, which uses only two symbols: typically ""0"" (zero) and ""1"" (one). For eg:- 3 written as 11, 4 as 100, 5 as 101 and so on.
We have some shifts in binary numbers called Bit shifts, The bit shifts are sometimes considered bitwise operations, because they treat a value as a series of bits rather than as a numerical quantity. In these operations the digits are moved, or shifted, to the left or right. For eg:- lets pick 10 it's binary representation will be 1010 by shifting the bits to the left means adding a zero at last that it the representation will become 10100 which donates 20, however a right shifts make it 101 which donates the number 5 one more right shift will delete the last 1 which makes the representation as 10 which depicts 2.

Let’s recall our memories of Logic Gates between two operators such as AND, OR, and XOR.
Let’s denote these operations using standard symbols used for them.
& - AND
|| - OR
^ - XOR
 
AND gate will be open only when both the operators are true. 
OR gate will be open when either of the operators is true
XOR gate will be open only when one of the operators is true and the other one is false
Now let's try to perform the logic gate operation between two numbers. For example:-
Let's take 3 and 5 which are 11 and 101 in binary 
3 & 5 :- 011(&) 101 = 001 = 1
3 || 5 :- 011(||)101 = 111 = 7

March compre 2,"We all know that a binary number is a number expressed in the base-2 numeral system or binary numeral system, which uses only two symbols: typically ""0"" (zero) and ""1"" (one). For eg:- 3 written as 11, 4 as 100, 5 as 101 and so on. 
Let’s recall our memories of Logic Gates between two operators such as AND, OR and XOR.
 Let’s denote these operations using standard symbols used for them.
& - AND
|| - OR
^ - XOR
 
AND gate will be open only when both the operators are true. 
OR gate will be open when either of the operators are true
XOR gate will be open only when one of the operator is true and the other one is false
Now let's try to perform the logic gate operation between two numbers. For example:-
Let's take 3 and 5 which are 11 and 101 in binary 
3 & 5 :- 011(&) 101 = 001 = 1
3 || 5 :- 011(||)101 = 111 = 7
3 ^ 5 :- 011(^)101 = 110 = 6

For a given number number N = 128. Find two numbers A and B such that A(XOR)B =  N and A*B is maximum also the number of bits in A and B should be equal to N. What will be the count of set bits in A and B(A>B)?",Multiple Choice Question,"1, 2, 3, 4",5 6,7 1,8 1,8 7,,D,-,LEVEL 1

October Entrance Section C - Slot 3,"Let's study some interesting facts about factors of a number today.
In the number system the concept of factors of numbers is one of the important subtopics. Factors of a number any number “ P”  refers to all the numbers which are exactly divisible on “P” i.e remainder comes to zero. These factors of numbers are also called divisors of a number.One way to check factors is to iterate from 1 to P and check for each number if it is a divisor or not. However we can do it more efficiently. We just have to iterate from 1 to square root of P.  Rest of the divisors can be found by just dividing the number P with the found divisor.
Now let's discuss the number of factors for a number. Number of factors for a number P totally depends upon its prime factors. More the number of prime factors more the number of divisors.
Moreover, only some special numbers have an odd number of factors.

August Entrance Section - C,"<b>Passage</b>

We know the maxima-minima concept that, If an integer needs to break in two parts, then to maximize their product those parts should be equal. Using this concept let's break n into (n/x) x’s then their product will be x(n/x), now if we take derivative of this product and make that equal to 0 for maxima, we will get to know that value of x should be e (base of the natural logarithm) for maximum product. As we know that 2 < e < 3, so we should break every Integer into 2 or 3 only for the maximum product.
Next thing is 6 = 3 + 3 = 2 + 2 + 2, but 3 * 3 > 2 * 2 * 2, that is every triplet of 2 can be replaced with tuple of 3 for maximum product, so we will keep breaking the number in terms of 3 only, until number remains as 4 or 2, which we will be broken into 2*2 (2*2 > 3*1) and 2 respectively and we will get our maximum product.

January Entrance Section C - Slot 2,"Modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers, which considers the remainder. In modular arithmetic, numbers ""wrap around"" upon reaching a given fixed quantity (this given quantity is known as the modulus) to leave a remainder. Modular arithmetic is often tied to prime numbers, for instance, in Wilson's theorem, Lucas's theorem, and Hensel's lemma, and generally appears in fields like cryptography, computer science, and computer algebra.

An intuitive usage of modular arithmetic is with a 12-hour clock. If it is 10:00 now, then in 5 hours the clock will show 3:00 instead of 15:00. 3 is the remainder of 15 with a modulus of 12.

A number x mod N is the equivalent of asking for the remainder of x when divided by N. Two integers a and b are said to be congruent (or in the same equivalence class) modulo N if they have the same remainder upon division by N. In such a case, we say that a≡b(modN).

A modulus operation is commonly expressed using the % operator. Eg 17%5=2 indicates that a remainder of 2 is left when 17 is divided by 5.

The operations of addition, multiplication and exponentiation follow the same rules under modular arithmetic. For example,

(7*3) % 5 = 21 % 5 = 1
Or
(7*3) % 5 = ((7%5) * (3%5)) % 5 = (2*3) % 5 = 6 % 5 = 1

Addition and exponentiation can be distributed over modulus in the same way.

May compe 2,"Let's have some fun with binary numbers today:-
We all know that a binary number is a number expressed in the base-2 numeral system or binary numeral system, which uses only two symbols: typically ""0"" (zero) and ""1"" (one). For eg:- 3 written as 11, 4 as 100, 5 as 101 and so on.
We have some shifts in binary numbers called Bit shifts, The bit shifts are sometimes considered bitwise operations, because they treat a value as a series of bits rather than as a numerical quantity. In these operations the digits are moved, or shifted, to the left or right. For eg:- lets pick 10 it's binary representation will be 1010 by shifting the bits to the left means adding a zero at last that it the representation will become 10100 which donates 20, however a right shifts make it 101 which donates the number 5 one more right shift will delete the last 1 which makes the representation as 10 which depicts 2.

Consider all numbers which  can be represented by the sum of different powers of 3. For eg:- 1(3^0), 4(3^0 + 3^1), 10(3^2 + 3^0) etc.. If we arrange them in ascending order, what will be the number of  820 (given that it is the sum of different powers of 3).",Multiple Choice Question,"1, 2, 3, 4",85,100,87,81,,A,-,LEVEL 1

We all know that a binary number is a number expressed in the base-2 numeral system or binary numeral system, which uses only two symbols: typically ""0"" (zero) and ""1"" (one). For eg:- 3 written as 11, 4 as 100, 5 as 101 and so on.
We have some shifts in binary numbers called as Bit shifts, The bit shifts are sometimes considered bitwise operations, because they treat a value as a series of bits rather than as a numerical quantity. In these operations the digits are moved, or shifted, to the left or right. For eg:- lets pick 10 it's binary representation will be 1010 by shifting the bits to the left means adding a zero at last that it the representation will become 10100 which donates 20, however a right shifts make it 101 which donates the number 5 one more right shift will delete the last 1 which makes the representation as 10 which depicts 2.
Also we have some operation in binary number as:-

XOR:-
The result of bitwise XOR operator is 1 if the corresponding bits of two operands are opposite.
Bitwise XOR Operation of 12 and 25
         01100

August Entrance Section - C,"<b>Passage</b>

We know the maxima-minima concept that, If an integer needs to break in two parts, then to maximize their product those parts should be equal. Using this concept let's break n into (n/x) x’s then their product will be x(n/x), now if we take the derivative of this product and make that equal to 0 for maxima, we will get to know that value of x should be e (base of the natural logarithm) for the maximum product. As we know that 2 < e < 3, so we should break every Integer into 2 or 3 only for the maximum product.
Next thing is 6 = 3 + 3 = 2 + 2 + 2, but 3 * 3 > 2 * 2 * 2, that is every triplet of 2 can be replaced with a tuple of 3 for a maximum product, so we will keep breaking the number in terms of 3 only until number remains as 4 or 2, which we will be broken into 2*2 (2*2 > 3*1) and 2 respectively and we will get our maximum product.

English Comprehension,"The Climate of India comprises a wide range of weather conditions across a vast geographic scale and varied topography, making generalisations difficult.<br />  Based on the Köppen system, India hosts six major climatic subtypes, ranging from arid desert in the west, alpine tundra and glaciers in the north,  ,<br />and humid tropical regions supporting rainforests in the southwest and the island territories. Many regions have starkly different microclimates. <br /> The country's meteorological department follows the international standard of four climatological seasons with some local adjustments: winter (December, January and February), <br /> summer (March, April and May), a monsoon rainy season (June to September), and a post-monsoon period (October to November).India's geography and geology are climatically pivotal: the Thar Desert in the northwest and the Himalayas in the north work in tandem to affect<br/> a culturally and economically important monsoonal regime. As Earth's highest and most massive mountain range, the Himalayas bar the influx of frigid katabatic winds from the <br />icy Tibetan Plateau and northerly Central Asia. Most of North India is thus kept warm or is only mildly chilly or cold during winter; the same thermal dam keeps most regions in India hot in summer.<br/><strong>Q1.

June Entrance Section C - Slot 2,"Gargi, Siddharth, and Nishant are three professional traders who trade in shares of a company ABC Ltd.
Gargi follows the strategy of buying at the opening of the day at 10 am and selling the whole lot at the close of the day at 3 pm.
Siddharth follows the strategy of buying at hourly intervals: 10 am, 11 am, 12 noon, 1 pm and 2 pm, and selling the whole lot at the close of the day. Further, he buys an equal number of shares in each purchase.
Nishant follows a similar pattern as Siddarth but his strategy is somewhat different. Nishant’s total investment amount is divided equally among his purchases.
The profit or loss made by each investor is the difference between the sale value at the close of the day less the investment in the purchase.
The “return” for each investor is defined as the ratio of the profit or loss to the investment amount expressed as a percentage.

One day, two other traders, Ritesh and Shreya joined Gargi, Siddharth and Nishant for trading in the shares of ABC Ltd.
Ritesh followed a strategy of buying equal numbers of shares at 10 am, 11 am and 12 noon, and selling the same numbers at 1 pm, 2 pm and 3 pm.
Shreya, on the other hand, followed the strategy of buying shares using all her money at 10 am and selling all of them at 12 noon and again buying the shares for all the money at 1 pm and again selling all of them at the close of the day at 3 pm.
At the close of the day the following was observed:
<ol>
<li>Gargi lost money in the transactions.</li>
<li>Both Ritesh and Shreya made profits.</li>

January Entrance Section C - Slot 2,"Modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers, which considers the remainder. In modular arithmetic, numbers ""wrap around"" upon reaching a given fixed quantity (this given quantity is known as the modulus) to leave a remainder. Modular arithmetic is often tied to prime numbers, for instance, in Wilson's theorem, Lucas's theorem, and Hensel's lemma, and generally appears in fields like cryptography, computer science, and computer algebra.

An intuitive usage of modular arithmetic is with a 12-hour clock. If it is 10:00 now, then in 5 hours the clock will show 3:00 instead of 15:00. 3 is the remainder of 15 with a modulus of 12.

A number x mod N is the equivalent of asking for the remainder of x when divided by N. Two integers a and b are said to be congruent (or in the same equivalence class) modulo N if they have the same remainder upon division by N. In such a case, we say that a≡b(modN).

A modulus operation is commonly expressed using the % operator. Eg 17%5=2 indicates that a remainder of 2 is left when 17 is divided by 5.

The operations of addition, multiplication and exponentiation follow the same rules under modular arithmetic. For example,

(7*3) % 5 = 21 % 5 = 1
Or
(7*3) % 5 = ((7%5) * (3%5)) % 5 = (2*3) % 5 = 6 % 5 = 1

Addition and exponentiation can be distributed over modulus in the same way.

October Entrance Section C - Slot 1,"Let's learn something new today:-
Suppose you want to find a word in a dictionary then what will you do, one way is that you start from the front page and compare each word, but that would take so long don't you think. The other way is that you randomly open a page compare the word then according to the word you search for either part of the dictionary and repeat the process until you find the word you seek. Now think of it as an approach for finding an element x in a sorted list of elements. The efficient way for finding element x will be:-
Compare x with the middle element. If x matches with the middle element, we found it.
Else If x is greater than the mid element, then x can only lie in right half after the mid element. So we recur for the right half.
Else (x is smaller) recur for the left half. We repeat the process until we find the element. i. e each time we cut the size of the list half.

May compe,"GCD or HCF of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them. A simple way to find GCD is to factorize both numbers and multiply common factors. Now for calculating it faster we can use tha facts:-
1. If we subtract smaller numbers from larger (we reduce larger number), GCD doesn’t change. So if we keep subtracting repeatedly the larger of two, we end up with GCD.
2. Now instead of subtraction, if we divide a smaller number, the algorithm stops when we find remainder 0.
By using these facts it will become easy to find the GCD of two numbers. 
Extending the approach can also be used to find the solutions of the equation for x and y:-
a⋅x+b⋅y=gcd of (a,b)

Let's have some fun with binary numbers today:-
We all know that a binary number is a number expressed in the base-2 numeral system or binary numeral system, which uses only two symbols: typically ""0"" (zero) and ""1"" (one). For eg:- 3 written as 11, 4 as 100, 5 as 101 and so on.
We have some shifts in binary numbers called as Bit shifts, The bit shifts are sometimes considered bitwise operations because they treat a value as a series of bits rather than as a numerical quantity. In these operations, the digits are moved, or shifted, to the left or right. For eg:- let's pick 10 it's binary representation will be 1010 by shifting the bits to the left means adding a zero at last that it the representation will become 10100 which donates 20, however, right shifts make it 101 which donates the number 5 one more right shift will delete the last 1 which makes the representation as 10 which depicts 2.
Also, we have some operation in a binary number is:-

XOR:-
The result of the bitwise XOR operator is 1 if the corresponding bits of two operands are opposite.
Bitwise XOR Operation of 12 and 25

October Entrance Section C - Slot 3,"Let's study some interesting facts about factors of a number today.
In the number system the concept of factors of numbers is one of the important subtopics. Factors of a number any number “ P”  refers to all the numbers which are exactly divisible on “P” i.e remainder comes to zero. These factors of numbers are also called divisors of a number.One way to check factors is to iterate from 1 to P and check for each number if it is a divisor or not. However we can do it more efficiently. We just have to iterate from 1 to square root of P.  Rest of the divisors can be found by just dividing the number P with the found divisor.
Now let's discuss the number of factors for a number. Number of factors for a number P totally depends upon its prime factors. More the number of prime factors more the number of divisors.
Moreover, only some special numbers have an odd number of factors.

If the minimum number less than 10000 which has the maximum number of factor is W. Then what is the number of prime factors in W.",Multiple Choice Question,"1, 2, 3, 4",5,10,3,9,,A,-,LEVEL 1
March compe 4,"The Decimal Number System is also called ""Base 10"", because it is based on the number 10. It has 10 symbols as 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. But notice something interesting: there is no symbol for ""ten"". ""10"" is actually two symbols put together, a ""1"" and a ""0""
In decimal you count ""0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,..."" but then you run out of symbols! So you add 1 on the left and then start again at 0: 10,11,12, ...
 Now similar to this we can have more number systems like binary where we use only 0 and 1 with the same concept as it was in decimal:-
0 -> 0, 1 -> 1, 2 -> 10, 3 -> 11, 4 -> 100. . . .. 15->1111.. and  so on.
Other than binary and decimal we have 
octal number system which uses:- {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7}
hexadecimal:-They look the same as the decimal numbers up to 9, but then there are the letters (""A',""B"",""C"",""D"",""E"",""F"") in place of the decimal numbers 10 to 15. For ex A5 = 165, B0 = 176

May 3rd Slot Comprehension,"We all know that a binary number is a number expressed in the base-2 numeral system or binary numeral system, which uses only two symbols: typically ""0"" (zero) and ""1"" (one). For eg:- 3 written as 11, 4 as 100, 5 as 101 and so on. And if we now increase the base we get base 3 form then base 4 form and so on. Like 15 in base 3 will be written as:- 120 = 3^2(1) + 3^1(2) + 3^0(0). The method to find the base is easy: you keep on dividing the decimal number with the base and note their remainder until the number becomes 0. It’s easy to see that in the base representation none of the digits can be equal to base or exceed it keeping that in mind the addition and subtraction operation will be performed. For eg in base 3 :- 120 + 110 =    1000. In decimal it will be 15 + 12 = 27. Also if the base exceeds 10 then we will use A,B,C,D.. instead of 10,11,12…..

March compe 3,"We know the maxima-minima concept that, If an integer needs to break in two parts, then to maximize their product those parts should be equal. Using this concept let's break n into (n/x) x’s then their product will be x(n/x), now if we take derivative of this product and make that equal to 0 for maxima, we will get to know that value of x should be e (base of the natural logarithm) for maximum product. As we know that 2 < e < 3, so we should break every Integer into 2 or 3 only for the maximum product.
Next thing is 6 = 3 + 3 = 2 + 2 + 2, but 3 * 3 > 2 * 2 * 2, that is every triplet of 2 can be replaced with tuple of 3 for maximum product, so we will keep breaking the number in terms of 3 only, until number remains as 4 or 2, which we will be broken into 2*2 (2*2 > 3*1) and 2 respectively and we will get our maximum product.

October Entrance Section C - Slot 1,"We know the maxima-minima concept that, If an integer needs to break in two parts, then to maximize their product those parts should be equal. Using this concept let's break n into (n/x) x’s then their product will be x(n/x), now if we take derivative of this product and make that equal to 0 for maxima, we will get to know that value of x should be e (base of the natural logarithm) for maximum product. As we know that 2 < e < 3, so we should break every Integer into 2 or 3 only for the maximum product.
Next thing is 6 = 3 + 3 = 2 + 2 + 2, but 3 * 3 > 2 * 2 * 2, that is every triplet of 2 can be replaced with tuple of 3 for maximum product, so we will keep breaking the number in terms of 3 only, until number remains as 4 or 2, which we will be broken into 2*2 (2*2 > 3*1) and 2 respectively and we will get our maximum product.

Section C,"Modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers, which considers the remainder. In modular arithmetic, numbers ""wrap around"" upon reaching a given fixed quantity (this given quantity is known as the modulus) to leave a remainder. Modular arithmetic is often tied to prime numbers, for instance, in Wilson's theorem, Lucas's theorem, and Hensel's lemma, and generally appears in fields like cryptography, computer science, and computer algebra.

An intuitive usage of modular arithmetic is with a 12-hour clock. If it is 10:00 now, then in 5 hours the clock will show 3:00 instead of 15:00. 3 is the remainder of 15 with a modulus of 12.

A number x mod N is the equivalent of asking for the remainder of x when divided by N. Two integers a and b are said to be congruent (or in the same equivalence class) modulo N if they have the same remainder upon division by N. In such a case, we say that a≡b(modN).

A modulus operation is commonly expressed using the % operator. Eg 17%5=2 indicates that a remainder of 2 is left when 17 is divided by 5.

The operations of addition, multiplication and exponentiation follow the same rules under modular arithmetic. For example,

(7*3) % 5 = 21 % 5 = 1
Or
(7*3) % 5 = ((7%5) * (3%5)) % 5 = (2*3) % 5 = 6 % 5 = 1

Addition and exponentiation can be distributed over modulus in the same way.

May compe 2,"Let's have some fun with binary numbers today:-
We all know that a binary number is a number expressed in the base-2 numeral system or binary numeral system, which uses only two symbols: typically ""0"" (zero) and ""1"" (one). For eg:- 3 written as 11, 4 as 100, 5 as 101 and so on.
We have some shifts in binary numbers called Bit shifts, The bit shifts are sometimes considered bitwise operations, because they treat a value as a series of bits rather than as a numerical quantity. In these operations the digits are moved, or shifted, to the left or right. For eg:- lets pick 10 it's binary representation will be 1010 by shifting the bits to the left means adding a zero at last that it the representation will become 10100 which donates 20, however a right shifts make it 101 which donates the number 5 one more right shift will delete the last 1 which makes the representation as 10 which depicts 2.

October Entrance Section C - Slot 1,"GCD or HCF of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them. A simple way to find GCD is to factorize both numbers and multiply common factors. Now to calculating it faster, we can use the facts:-
If we subtract the smaller number from the larger (we reduce the larger number), GCD doesn’t change. So if we keep subtracting repeatedly the larger of two, we end up with GCD.
Now instead of subtraction, if we divide smaller number, the algorithm stops when we find remainder 0.
By using these facts it will become easy to find the GCD of two numbers. 
Extending the approach can also be used to find the solutions of the equation for x and y:-
a⋅x+b⋅y=gcd of (a, b)

Section C,"Expected value (also known as EV, expectation, average, or mean value) is a long-run average value of random variables. It also indicates the probability-weighted average of all possible values. 
The first variation of the expected value formula is the EV of one event repeated several times (think about tossing a coin). In such a case, the EV can be found using the following formula:
 Where:
EV – the expected value
P(X) – the probability of the event
n – the number of the repetitions of the event
 However, in finance, many problems related to the expected value involve multiple events. In such a scenario, the EV is the probability-weighted average of all possible events. Therefore, the general formula to find the EV for multiple events is EV = ∑ P(X<sub>i</sub>) *X<sub>i</sub> Where
EV = Expected Value
P(X<sub>i</sub>) = Probability of the even
X<sub>i</sub> = Event

May compe,"GCD or HCF of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them. A simple way to find GCD is to factorize both numbers and multiply common factors. Now for calculating it faster we can use tha facts:-
1. If we subtract smaller numbers from larger (we reduce larger number), GCD doesn’t change. So if we keep subtracting repeatedly the larger of two, we end up with GCD.
2. Now instead of subtraction, if we divide a smaller number, the algorithm stops when we find remainder 0.
By using these facts it will become easy to find the GCD of two numbers. 
Extending the approach can also be used to find the solutions of the equation for x and y:-
a⋅x+b⋅y=gcd of (a,b)

June Entrance Section C - Slot 2,"Expected value (also known as EV, expectation, average, or mean value) is a long-run average value of random variables. It also indicates the probability-weighted average of all possible values. 
The first variation of the expected value formula is the EV of one event repeated several times (think about tossing a coin). In such a case, the EV can be found using the following formula:
 Where:
<ul>
<li>EV – the expected value</li>
<li>P(X) – the probability of the event</li>
<li>n – the number of the repetitions of the event</li>
</ul>

However, in finance, many problems related to the expected value involve multiple events. In such a scenario, the EV is the probability-weighted average of all possible events. Therefore, the general formula to find the EV for multiple events is: EV = ∑ P(X<sub>i</sub>) *X<sub>i</sub> Where
EV = Expected Value

October Entrance Section C - Slot 3,"Let's have some fun with binary numbers today:-
We all know that a binary number is a number expressed in the base-2 numeral system or binary numeral system, which uses only two symbols: typically ""0"" (zero) and ""1"" (one). For eg:- 3 written as 11, 4 as 100, 5 as 101 and so on.
We have some shifts in binary numbers called as Bit shifts, The bit shifts are sometimes considered bitwise operations, because they treat a value as a series of bits rather than as a numerical quantity. In these operations the digits are moved, or shifted, to the left or right. For eg:- lets pick 10 it's binary representation will be 1010 by shifting the bits to the left means adding a zero at last that it the representation will become 10100 which donates 20, however a right shifts make it 101 which donates the number 5 one more right shift will delete the last 1 which makes the representation as 10 which depicts 2.
Also we have some operation in binary number as:-

XOR:-
The result of bitwise XOR operator is 1 if the corresponding bits of two operands are opposite.

As a compromise, he tells them that every Sunday, he’ll head to the subway station nearest to his apartment at a random time of the day and will hop on the next train that arrives.

For eg:- If N = 4 and Asta goes first then he can select 4 and 3 Asta’s score will be 7 and the sequence will be 1, 2, 7 Now Yuno can select 7 and 2 his score will be 9 and the sequence will be 1, 9. Now Asta will select 1, 9 and his score will be 17 and the resulting sequence will be 10.

October Entrance Section C - Slot 3,"Let's have some fun with binary numbers today:-
We all know that a binary number is a number expressed in the base-2 numeral system or binary numeral system, which uses only two symbols: typically ""0"" (zero) and ""1"" (one). For eg:- 3 written as 11, 4 as 100, 5 as 101 and so on.
We have some shifts in binary numbers called as Bit shifts, The bit shifts are sometimes considered bitwise operations, because they treat a value as a series of bits rather than as a numerical quantity. In these operations the digits are moved, or shifted, to the left or right. For eg:- lets pick 10 it's binary representation will be 1010 by shifting the bits to the left means adding a zero at last that it the representation will become 10100 which donates 20, however a right shifts make it 101 which donates the number 5 one more right shift will delete the last 1 which makes the representation as 10 which depicts 2.
Also we have some operation in binary number as:-

XOR:-
The result of bitwise XOR operator is 1 if the corresponding bits of two operands are opposite.
Bitwise XOR Operation of 12 and 25

Let’s recall our memories of Logic Gates between two operators such as AND, OR, and XOR.
Let’s denote these operations using standard symbols used for them.
& - AND
|| - OR
^ - XOR
 
AND gate will be open only when both the operators are true. 
OR gate will be open when either of the operators is true
XOR gate will be open only when one of the operators is true and the other one is false
Now let's try to perform the logic gate operation between two numbers. For example:-
Let's take 3 and 5 which are 11 and 101 in binary 
3 & 5 :- 011(&) 101 = 001 = 1
3 || 5 :- 011(||)101 = 111 = 7
3 ^ 5 :- 011(^)101 = 110 = 6

March compe 3,"We know the maxima-minima concept that, If an integer needs to break in two parts, then to maximize their product those parts should be equal. Using this concept let's break n into (n/x) x’s then their product will be x(n/x), now if we take derivative of this product and make that equal to 0 for maxima, we will get to know that value of x should be e (base of the natural logarithm) for maximum product. As we know that 2 < e < 3, so we should break every Integer into 2 or 3 only for the maximum product.
Next thing is 6 = 3 + 3 = 2 + 2 + 2, but 3 * 3 > 2 * 2 * 2, that is every triplet of 2 can be replaced with tuple of 3 for maximum product, so we will keep breaking the number in terms of 3 only, until number remains as 4 or 2, which we will be broken into 2*2 (2*2 > 3*1) and 2 respectively and we will get our maximum product.
